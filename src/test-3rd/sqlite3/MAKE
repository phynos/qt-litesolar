#  Example Makefile for building a program with embedded Duktape.
#
#  There are two source sets in the distribution: (1) combined sources where
#  you only need duktape.c, duktape.h, and duk_config.h, and (2) separate
#  sources where you have a bunch of source and header files.  Whichever
#  you use, simply include the relevant sources into your C project.  This
#  Makefile uses the combined source file.
